## Task 1: Arithmetic Operators

# 1. Create two variables `a` and `b` with numeric values.
# 2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
# 3. Print the results.

a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)

# Task 2: Relational Operators

# 1. Create two variables `a` and `b` with different numeric values.
# Compare the values of `a` and `b` using the following comparison operators: `<`, `>`, 
# `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`.
# 2. Print the results of each comparison.


a = 10
b = 5
print("a < b:", a < b)
print("a > b:", a > b)
print("a <= b:", a <= b)
print("a >= b:", a >= b)
print("a == b:", a == b)
print("a != b:", a != b)	


## Task 3: Logical Operators

# 1. Create two boolean variables, `x` and `y`.
# 2. Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to perform various logical operations on `x` and `y`.
# 3. Print the results.

x = True
y = False

and_result = x and y
or_result = x or y
not_result_x = not x
not_result_y = not y

print("x and y:", and_result)
print("x or y:", or_result)
print("not x:", not_result_x)
print("not y:", not_result_y)


## Task 4: Assignment Operators

# 1. Create a variable `total` and initialize it to 10.
# 2. Use assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) to update the value of `total`.
# 3. Print the final value of `total`.

Total = 10
Total += 11
Total -= 3	
Total *= 2
Total /= 4

print("Final total:", Total)
